This project involves the development of a robust, web-based management system tailored for a factory that processes and sells blueberries. The system offers several key functionalities:

Purchase Tracking: Accurately records blueberry purchases from farmers, ensuring seamless procurement management.
Categorization and Packaging: Classifies blueberries into distinct package sizes based on weight, each with its own pricing structure.
Sales Management: Tracks sales transactions efficiently, providing real-time insights into customer orders and revenue.
Financial Management: Offers detailed calculations for income, expenses, taxes, and profit, ensuring a clear overview of the factory's financial health.
Inventory Tracking: Monitors stock levels to optimize packaging and sales operations, preventing shortages or overstocking.
The system is designed to improve operational efficiency, enhance decision-making, and provide a centralized platform for managing all aspects of the factory's workflow. Ideal for modernizing agricultural production and distribution processes.
